# 2017PyProject
This repository consists of my Fall 2017 project for Python Programming for ArcGIS.
The project I decided to take on is making an interactive game. The game I decided to try is a simple game of Hangman. 
A word guessing game. 
The reason I wanted to do a project like this, is because I wanted to produce something fun and possibly doable for a person
just starting out with Python Programming. 
I used notes taken from class, GISC 3200k-Python Programming for GIS, as well as a website for further help. www.pythonforbeginners.com
simple codes shown in class were mainly used to make this code. The code starts but I can not seem to make it work fully. It needs a little more tweaking for it to work the way I wanted it to.
