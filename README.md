# 2017PyProject

This repository consists of my Fall 2017 project for Python Programming for ArcGIS.
The project I decided to take on is making an interactive game. The game I decided to try is a simple game of Hangman. 
A word guessing game. 

The reason I wanted to do a project like this, is because I wanted to produce something fun and possibly doable for a person
just starting out with Python Programming. 

I used notes taken from class, GISC 3200k-Python Programming for GIS, https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html to learn about the "time" module, as well as another website for further help on the main part of the code. www.pythonforbeginners.com
Simple codes shown in class were mainly used to make this code but the code still works, though i think it needs a little more tweaking for it to work the way I wanted it to. 
For instance, I would like to make it add to a an actual Hangman figure. That would be a nice touch I think.
The only problem I had was learning the "time" module and all that took was a little research on https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html. as well as the many, many errors it took before I got the process i wanted to show.
